<h2>üç∞ Installing SFML to run code:</h2>
1. Go to https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1 and download the SFML package library that corresponds to your system. For example, a 64-bit machine running MinGW, you will download the package here:

2. Once the download is complete, locate it and extract the zip file somewhere on your computer. It shouldn't matter where you have it, but you must keep it there while running this code.

3. Now we need to get the <sfml root prefix>. Open the SFML-2.5.1 file you downloaded earlier and copy the path to that folder. This can be done by clicking on the path bar near the top of your File Explorer window:

4. Copy that path and paste it into the CMakeLists.txt file, replacing the file path that currently exists.

5. After this step, in some instances your IDE may not automatically reset the cache and reload the project. In order to do so manually, go to: Tools > CMake > Reset Cache and Reload Project
